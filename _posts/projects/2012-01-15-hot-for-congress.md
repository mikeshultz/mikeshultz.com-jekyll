### Summary 

Hot For Congress was a site to rate the attractiveness between members of the US Congress. It measured the 111th congress using data and photographs from Project Vote Smart.

The site was closed due to PVS paywalling their API. The overall results are currently displayed on the home page and more detailed analysis may come later. This project may resume at some point using a different data source.
