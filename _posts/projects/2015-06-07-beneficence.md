### Summary

A multi-tenant donor relationship manager(DRM) possibly offered for free or at cost for higher teir users.  It's in very early stages of planning and prototyping and not very active at the moment.

### Purpose

Almost all the options out there for non-profit organizations for a DRM are really expensive and fairly low quality.  The purpose of this project is to create a viable option for NPOs without a 5-figure budget to use a functional and featureful service.  At this point, it's also planned to have it as open source, so some NPOs and volunteers can extend even run their own in-house versions.
