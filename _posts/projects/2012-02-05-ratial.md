### Summary 

*I let this domain expire.  I may revive this at some point but for the time being, it will stay dead.*

A visual box model editor. It allows you to adjust things like the size of a box while locking the ratio in place. Handy when you want to get the size of a while keeping some aspect the same without opening up Photoshop or something like it.

The main site will be an actual use for this code to manipulate and size box elements using ratios. The driving code will be released open source but has not been yet.  The project has reached the first stage ready for release and will be updated in the future.
