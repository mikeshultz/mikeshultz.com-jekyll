### Summary

What The Diff(WTD) is a system for tracking content changes on Web pages.  The intiial concept came up because researchers and Project Vote Smart wanted a way to track when certain Web pages are updated and then to see what actually changed.  For the most part, this ignores all design changes, which some other tools focus on.  

The project is currently in a public alpha state while I work with Vote Smart staff and interns as my primary testers but anyone can sign up.

### Purpose

Almost all the options out there for non-profit organizations for a DRM are really expensive and fairly low quality.  The purpose of this project is to create a viable option for NPOs without a 5-figure budget to use a functional and featureful service.  At this point, it's also planned to have it as open source, so some NPOs and volunteers can extend even run their own in-house versions.
